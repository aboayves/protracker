<h2><a name="Overview"></a>Overview</h2>
<p>Use the Reports module to create and manage reports on any module such as Clients, Contracts, and Opportunities. You can also create reports to track user activity such as viewed modules, modified records, and other activities.</p>
<p>The Reports list displays reports in the order that you viewed them, with the most recently viewed report at the top of the list. The date and time when you last viewed the report is displayed in the Accessed On column.</p>
<p>You can view charts in PDF format generated while viewing reports in an HTML5 browser.</p>
<p>ProTracker provides several pre-defined reports. These are listed on the Reports List View. You can also create custom reports for your requirements. These include reports on clients, activities, and usage metrics. All existing reports are listed on the Reports Home page. You can click a report name to view its contents.</p>
<p>You can run a report immediately when you create it or you can schedule it at a later date. You can also schedule it to run at specific time intervals. For more information on scheduling, see <a href="#ScheduleReport">Scheduling Reports</a>.</p>
<p>You can also create a list of favorite reports that you frequently access. This allows you to group reports that may not share common searchable criteria.</p>
<p>You can view frequently used reports through ProTracker Dashlets on your Home page. You can view a report with charts as a chart Dashlet. To view reports without charts through a Dashlet, you will need to add them to your list of favorite reports. For more information on Dashlets, see <A href="https://protracker.zendesk.com/entries/2379836">Managing ProTracker Dashlets</a>.</p>
<p>You can search for an existing report using the Search panel on the Reports home page. The search panel allows you to search for reports by criteria such as a specific module, report type, report title, and so on. </p>
<p>The Reports module displays options to view existing reports for specific modules.
</p>
<h3><a name="ReportTypes">Report types</a></h3>
<p>The following types of reports are available in ProTracker:</p>
<ul><li><strong>Summation:</strong> A summation report displays the computed data of records that match the specified criteria.<br>
A summation report can group the summary data by a date range or by field values such as Type, Lead Source, and Sales Stage and display the total count. You can choose from an additional set of columns which display data values from records within the selected module if the report contains a grouping. These include computed derivatives from numeric-only data values such as SUM, AVG, MAX, MIN, and a weighted average.<br>
Summation reports can be viewed in a chart format and displayed as a ProTracker Dashlet on your Home page. You can click any segment of the chart to drill-down and view details.
</li>
<li><strong>Summation with Details:</strong> In addition to the total count of records, this report enables you to group data and view more details related to the records in the report. The group-by data is visually represented in the report output. For example, you can group records by the assigned user and sort the results in ascending or descending order.
</li>
<li><strong>Rows and Columns:</strong> A Rows and Column report displays data in rows and columns that reflect the value of selected fields such as Name and Address.</li>
<li><strong>Matrix:</strong> Matrix reports are similar to summation reports but unlike summation reports, a matrix report displays results in a grid format. The report displays totals for all summaries. You can use a maximum of three group-by columns to group the data. You can also choose a layout option to view the report results.</li>
</ul>
<h3><a name="SettingFilters"></a>Setting filters</h3>
<p>Filters are fields, operators, and optionally, values (depending on the operator).</p>
<P>Use the Add Filter Group button to create filter groups. Create nested filter groups with a combination of
AND and OR operators for complex queries with several filtering levels.</p>
<P>The choices for operators vary, depending on whether you have selected a text field, numeric field, or date field.</p>
<ul><li>Operators for text fields can be Is, Is Not, Equals, Does Not Equal, Contains, Does not Contain, Starts With, Ends With, and, Is Not One Of, Is Empty, and Is Not Empty.</li>
<li>Operators for numeric fields can be any of the following: Equals, Does Not Equal, Less Than, Greater Than, Is Between (requires two numeric values), Is Empty, Is Not Empty.</li>
<li>Operators for date fields can be any of the following: On, Before, After, Is Between (requires two date values), Not On, Is Empty, Is Not Empty, Yesterday, Today, Tomorrow, Last 7 Days, Next 7 Days, Last Month, This Month, Next Month, Last 30 days, Next 30 days, Last Year, This Year, and Next Year.</li></ul>
<P>Use the User Name field to run a report on one or more users. For example, you can run a report on all opportunities assigned to Chris, or to Chris and Will. Similarly, you can use the Team ID.</p>
<P>If the assigned user or a member of your team adds a new filter, the system alerts you of the change when you run the report.</p>
<P>A dynamic filter called Current User is available in ProTracker. The Current User is any user who is currently logged in and running the report. This filter enables you to create one report for multiple users. For example, you can create one report on all clients assigned to Current User. When a member of your team runs this report, the report results automatically reflect the member's assigned clients because the Current User is the person who is logged in and running the report.</p>
<P>You can filter by record and/or by user for reports on activities such as calls, meetings, and tasks. For example, you can run a report on meetings held in the last month regarding a specific case number or for all cases assigned to a specific user.</p>
<P>ProTracker saves the report definition when you create and save a report. Only the assigned user or a member of the assigned team has the permission to change the report definition. If the report definition is modified, the system displays an alert when you try to run the report.
<h4>Run-time filters</h4>
<p>A Run-time option enables you to modify report filter values in the Report Viewer when you view the report. The Report Wizard retains the original filter values for the report, regardless of changes you or other users make to the run-time filters while viewing the report. Each user's run-time filter values are preserved for future use when they view the report again. This enables users to modify certain filters in a shared report without altering the original filter values. Users can click the Reset button to restore the original run-time values.</p>
