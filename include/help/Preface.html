<h2><a name="Overview">Overview</a></h2>
<p>Welcome to ProTracker Web, a Client Relationship Management (CRM) application for financial professionals. This guide assumes that you have the required resources to access the ProTracker application and you are familiar with how to use them. Contact your database administrator for issues and concerns.</p>
<h2><a name="ProTrackerApp">The ProTracker Application</a></h2>
<p>ProTracker enables organizations to organize, populate, and maintain information efficiently on all aspects of their client relationships. It provides integrated management of corporate information on clients, investment accounts, contacts, sales leads and opportunities, plus activities such as calls, meetings, and assigned tasks. The system seamlessly blends all the functions required to manage information on many aspects of your business into an intuitive and user-friendly graphical interface.</p>
<p>For sales-oriented organizations, the system also offers a graphical dashboard to track business intelligence, the sales pipeline, the most successful lead sources, and the month-by-month outcomes for opportunities in the pipeline.</p>
<h2><a name="Audience">Audience</a></h2>
<p>This guide is designed for users and administrators who are new to ProTracker, or to CRM and web-based applications.</p>
<h2><a name="FeatureOverview">Feature Overview</a></h2>
<p>ProTracker consists of modules, each of which represents a specific functional aspect of the CRM such as Clients, Activities, Leads, and Opportunities. For example, the Clients module enables you to create and manage client relationships, and the Activities module enables you to create and manage activities related to clients, contacts, opportunities, etc. These modules are designed to help you manage clients through each step of their life cycle. Many of these steps are interrelated and as a result, each module displays related information. For example, when you view the details of a particular client, the system also displays the related contacts, activities, opportunities, and accounts. You can view, edit, and create this information.</p>
<p>As a database administrator, you have the power to implement access control for these modules.</p>
