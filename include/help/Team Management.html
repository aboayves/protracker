<p>This article describes how to manage teams.</p>
<P>Use the Team Management option to group users into teams to manage records in a secure manner. Teams provide data security because users can access a record only if they are members of a team that is assigned to manage the record. Teams apply to every record in ProTracker. All records are assigned to at least one team, and can be assigned to more than one team. A user can belong to one or more teams. The following teams are available:
<ul><li>Private: ProTracker creates a private team for every user. Only the user can access and manage records assigned to the user's own private team. Private teams include the reporting hierarchy. Users can see the records of any user who is below them in the hierarchy, regardless of their team membership.
</li>
<li>Global: This is the universal team. When users are created, they are members of the Global team by default. Every user can view records assigned to the Global team. You cannot delete the Global team.</li>
</ul>
<p>Users can be both explicitly and implicitly assigned to teams, and will appear as either Member, or Member Reports-to. When a user is manually, or explicitly, assigned to a team, the user's reporting hierarchy is implicitly added to the team as well. This ensures that members of the user's management hierarchy also have visibility into the user's records. For example, if Will and Chris both report to Jim, and Will is a member of the East team, and Chris is a member of the West team, then Jim will be an implicit member of the East and West teams. To delete Jim from the West team, either Chris must be removed from the West team, or he must no longer report to Jim.</p>
<p>Implicit members appear as Member Reports-to in the Membership column. Implicit team membership has the following characteristics:</p>
<ul><li>Implicit team members cannot be removed from teams; the Remove icon does not
appear next to their names.</li>
<li>Implicit team members can also be explicitly, or manually, assigned to teams; the Remove icon will appear next to their names.</li>
<li>Due to the implicit membership, clicking the Remove icon will not remove them from the team.</li>
<li>To remove an implicit member from a team, either a down-level user in the reporting hierarchy must be removed from the team, OR the reporting hierarchy must be broken.</li></ul>
<p>
You can create any number of teams, depending on the needs of your organization. For example, based on the reporting hierarchy, you may want to create a team of users who report to the same manager. Based on client service requirements, you may want to create a cross-functional team of users who report to different managers but who manage the same client.</p>
<p>
By default, all ProTracker records such as accounts, contracts, and opportunities are assigned to a specific team and can only be accessed by the members of that team. If users spread across teams need to access a record, it can be assigned to multiple teams. In such cases, the user who creates the record can select a primary team and one or more secondary teams.</p>
<P>Important Note: Users who are assigned to a record can access it regardless of team membership.</P>
